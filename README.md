## Description
This set of demonstrations and/or labs explores how to build and reason with single AI agents using both **LangChain** and **DSPy**, two complementary frameworks for developing modular, tool-enabled AI systems on Databricks. You’ll first see how to integrate **Unity Catalog (UC) functions** as reusable tools within the LangChain framework, allowing an agent powered by **Mosaic AI Model Serving** to reason and take action. Then, you’ll learn how **DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python)** provides a declarative, code-first approach to constructing reliable and maintainable AI applications through modular components such as `dspy.Predict`, `dspy.ChainOfThought`, and `dspy.ReAct`. Together, these demonstrations showcase both imperative and declarative approaches to building intelligent, tool-aware agents on the Databricks platform. Finally, you will able to test your knowledge with the LangChain via a hands-on lab. 


## Learning Objectives
- Understand the separation of tasks between tools, models, and agentic frameworks
- Know the process of registering, testing, and integrating Unity Catalog functions with LangChain using the `UCFunctionToolkit`
- Configure and execute a LangChain agent with tool-calling capabilities
- Know how to view and interpret the trace summary of agent execution and analyze decision-making using MLflow
- Explain what DSPy is and how it differs from traditional prompt engineering
- Configure DSPy to work with Databricks Model Serving endpoints
- Create simple reasoning chains using `dspy.ChainOfThought`
- Define custom tools (functions) that agents can use to interact with data
- Build a ReAct agent using `dspy.ReAct` that combines reasoning and tool execution
- Interpret agent trajectories and understand the reasoning process behind agent decisions
